#Employee Management System
 
📝 Overview
This is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee records. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The backend is built with Java and Spring Boot, serving a REST API, while the frontend is a responsive single-page application built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled with Tailwind CSS.

✨ Features
* Create Employee: Add new employees to the database via a simple form.
* Read Employees: View a complete list of all employees in a clean, organized table.
* Update Employee: Easily edit the details of any existing employee. The form is pre-filled with their current information.
* Delete Employee: Remove employees from the database with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.
* Responsive Design: The user interface is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following software installed:
* JDK 21 or later
* Apache Maven
* MariaDB Server
* Postman (optional, for API testing)
* A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

Backend Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://your-repository-url.git](https://your-repository-url.git)
cd your-project-directory

(If you don't use Git, simply place all the Java project files in a single folder.)
2. Database Configuration
   * Start your MariaDB server.
   * Connect to MariaDB and create the database for the project:
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS employee_db;

   * Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file.
   * Update the spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password properties to match your MariaDB root credentials.
      3. Run the Application
      * Open your terminal in the root directory of the project.
      * Run the application using Maven:
mvn spring-boot:run

      * The backend server will start on http://localhost:8080. The tables in the database will be created automatically.

Frontend Setup
         1. Place the Files
         * Ensure index.html, style.css, and script.js are all in the same folder.
         2. Launch the UI
         * Open the index.html file directly in your web browser.
         * The application should be fully functional, communicating with the backend server running on localhost:8080.
